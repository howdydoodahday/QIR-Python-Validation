# Quantum Information Gravity (QIR) Python Testing Framework

## **What This Is**
This repository contains Python scripts designed to test and validate Quantum Information Gravity (QIR) across multiple scales.  
These scripts replicate the mathematical and computational methods used in our research, ensuring testability and reproducibility.  

## **How to Use These Scripts**
Each script is self-contained and executes specific QIR-related tests. Full documentation for each script is available in the `/docs` folder.  
To run a script, simply execute:  
```sh
python script_name.py
