# Quantum Information Gravity (QIR) Python Testing Framework

## **What This Is**
This repository contains Python scripts designed to test and validate **Quantum Information Gravity (QIR)** across multiple scales.  
These scripts replicate the mathematical and computational methods used in our research, ensuring **testability and reproducibility**.

## **How to Use These Scripts**
Each script is self-contained and executes specific QIR-related tests.  
To run a script, navigate to the repository folder and execute:  
```sh
python script_name.py
