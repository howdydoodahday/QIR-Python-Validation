# QIR Gravitational Lensing Simulation

## **Purpose**
This script models gravitational lensing based on Quantum Information Gravity (QIR) modifications.

## **Mathematical Basis**
The lensing equation used in this script is:
\[
\theta_E = \frac{4GM}{c^2 D} + \alpha
\]
where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant
- \( M \) is the mass of the lens
- \( D \) is the distance between observer and lens
- \( \alpha \) is the QIR correction term

## **How to Run**
```sh
python QIR_Gravitational_Lensing.py
