# QIR Quantum Uncertainty Simulation

## **Purpose**
This script tests the quantum uncertainty relations as predicted by Quantum Information Gravity (QIR).

## **Mathematical Basis**
The quantum uncertainty relation in QIR is given by:
\[
\Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{m c} \frac{1}{I(x)}
\]
where:
- \( \hbar \) is Planckâ€™s constant
- \( m \) is the particle mass
- \( c \) is the speed of light
- \( I(x) \) is the information density at position \( x \)

## **How to Run**
```sh
python QIR_Quantum_Uncertainty.py
